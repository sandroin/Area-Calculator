# Area-Calculator
This is a simple project that can be used to calculate the area and perimeter of geometric objects such as triangles, circles, etc. Users need to input the required values and click the "calculate" button to obtain the area and perimeter. The program also validates input values and displays an error message if they violate the rules for valid objects.
